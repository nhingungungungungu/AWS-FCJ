### Week 3 Achievements:

* IAM Policy Engineering: Gained expertise in writing, testing, and applying complex IAM Policies:

    * Created custom policies using JSON syntax to enforce strict, granular access rules.

    * Successfully implemented and verified policies adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).

* Cross-Service Security: Established secure communication between services:

    * Configured an IAM Role and attached it to an EC2 instance

* Proactive Cost Governance: Established and configured AWS Budgets to gain control over service spending:

    * Set up budgets with specific thresholds and alert mechanisms (via SNS).

    * Ensured adherence to cost management guidelines.

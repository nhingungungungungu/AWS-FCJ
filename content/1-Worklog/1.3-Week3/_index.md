### Week 3 Objectives:

* Compute Deployment: Successfully launch an EC2 Instance in the Public Subnet of the created VPC.
* Access Management: Configure Key Pair (ED25519) and Security Group for secure SSH access.
* Application Authorization: Use IAM Role to grant S3 access to EC2 without storing Access Keys on the machine.
* Block Storage: Create, attach, and format an additional EBS Volume to understand persistent storage.

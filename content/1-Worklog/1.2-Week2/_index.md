### Week 2 Achievements:

* Advanced Networking Implementation: Designed and deployed a robust 2-Tier VPC architecture, confirming fundamental networking concepts:
    * Established distinct Public and Private Subnets across two Availability Zones for high resilience.

    * Securely configured a NAT Gateway for controlled outbound access from Private Subnets.

* Implemented Security Controls: Understood the difference between and successfully implemented Security Groups and Network ACLs.

* Enterprise Storage Configuration: Mastered and configured Amazon S3 for advanced use cases:
    * Set up Bucket Policies and enabled Static Website Hosting.

    * Implemented a comprehensive Lifecycle Policy to automatically transition data to lower-cost tiers

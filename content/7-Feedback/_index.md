### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The environment at FCJ is professional, open, and technology-oriented. I appreciated the "open communication" culture, where all opinions are welcomed. The workspace is tidy, comfortable, and encourages creativity. High project pressure sometimes created stress, so short breaks or small team activities would be helpful.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor gave clear guidance, encouraged me to solve problems independently, and explained concepts patiently. The admin team supported procedures and documentation, which allowed me to work smoothly.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
As a Frontend developer and content contributor, my tasks allowed me to apply academic knowledge and learn how frontend components integrate with backend (.NET) and AWS services. This expanded my understanding of real-world software development.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
I gained experience with **React/Next.js**, cloud-based workflows, Agile/Scrum, and professional source code management. Code reviews and progress meetings improved my communication and presentation skills.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The culture is very positive: everyone is respectful, collaborative, and maintains a cheerful atmosphere. Even when mistakes occur, colleagues support each other to find solutions, which motivates interns.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
Interns receive clear guidance, access to an AWS account for practice, and internal training sessions. Flexible work arrangements and mentorship make the experience very valuable.

### Additional Questions

- **Most satisfying aspect:** Participating in real projects and seeing my frontend work deployed on the website.  
- **Areas for improvement:** More soft skills workshops on Time Management and Work Discipline.  
- **Recommendation to friends:** Yes – great exposure to cloud technologies, teamwork, and professional work culture.

### Suggestions & Expectations

- Introduce “check-point” milestones for discipline and attitude every 2 weeks to give early feedback.  
- I hope to continue working with FCJ or AWS in the future in higher positions.  
- **Other comments:** Thank you FCJ for this memorable internship. The patience of my mentor and team was my greatest motivation.

>Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program, helping the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The environment at FCJ is very professional, dynamic, and technology-focused. What impressed me most is the "Open communication" culture – where all opinions are heard. The workspace stimulates creativity, especially with cloud infrastructure and resources always available for interns to experience. However, sometimes high project pressure creates a somewhat tense atmosphere. I think having additional short break-time activities would help everyone recharge better.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don't understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports procedures, documentation, and creates favorable conditions for me to work smoothly. I highly appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving answers.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The program helped me expand my comfort zone, from only knowing how to write frontend code to understanding how the frontend interacts with backend systems and cloud infrastructure. This is valuable supplementary knowledge that schools rarely have the opportunity to delve into deeply.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
Besides technical skills (React Native, AWS Services), I learned a lot about Agile/Scrum software development processes and professional source code management. Especially through code reviews and progress meetings, I realized the importance of communication and presentation skills – areas I am striving to improve daily.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but remains cheerful. The spirit of "Ownership" is highly valued. All members support each other wholeheartedly. Even when I made mistakes due to not following procedures, instead of criticism, everyone sat down together to help me find solutions. This made me feel accepted and motivated to change positively.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The rights regarding internship certification support are very clear. The biggest advantage is being provided an AWS account to practice freely without worrying about costs – an extremely practical benefit for technical people. Additionally, being able to participate in internal training sessions is a major plus.


### Additional Questions
- What did you find **most satisfying** during your internship?<br>
  It was the opportunity to "do real work". I was directly involved in building a complex product and saw my code running in reality on devices, not just limited to simulated exercises.
- What do you think the company **should improve** for future interns?<br>
  I think the company should organize more in-depth soft skills workshops from the beginning of the term, especially on Time Management and Work Discipline. For new students like me, transitioning from an academic environment to a professional work environment sometimes causes "culture shock" regarding schedules and processes.
- If recommending to a friend, would you **suggest they intern here**? Why or why not?<br>
  Definitely yes. This is an ideal environment to "push" yourself to mature. You will not only learn cutting-edge technology (Cloud, IoT) but also cultivate the serious work attitude of a true software engineer.


### Suggestions & Expectations
- Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?<br>
  I suggest the program could establish "Check-point" milestones for discipline and attitude every 2 weeks (instead of only evaluating technical skills). Early feedback on work style will help interns adjust their behavior in time, avoiding procedural errors at the end of the term.
- Would you like to continue this program in the future?<br>
  I very much hope to have the opportunity to continue working with FCJ or AWS in higher positions (such as Fresher or Junior) after overcoming my current weaknesses.
- Any other comments (free sharing):<br>**Thank you FCJ for giving me a memorable journey. Although I still have many shortcomings to improve, the patience of my Mentor and Team has been the greatest motivation for me to persevere to the end.**

During my internship at **AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED** from **12/08** to **12/12**, I participated in the **Jewelry Web Application** project as a **Frontend developer** and content contributor. My main responsibilities included implementing user interface components using **React/Next.js** and preparing product content for the website.  

Based on our **AWS architecture**, the project backend was developed in **.NET**, and I collaborated with the team to integrate frontend components. While I did not directly work on backend services, I became familiar with the **AWS services** used in the project, including:  
- **Amazon S3:** storing product images and static assets.  
- **Amazon RDS:** database for products, users, and orders.  
- **Amazon CloudFront:** content delivery to improve page load speed.  
- **AWS Lambda:** serverless tasks handled by backend team.  
- **Amazon API Gateway & Cognito:** managing APIs and authentication.  

This experience helped me understand how frontend interacts with backend and cloud services, coordinate within a team, and maintain a workflow consistent with real-world cloud-based web projects.

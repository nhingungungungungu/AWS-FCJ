During my internship at **AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED** from **09/08** to **[end date]**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  
I participated in the **VoltGo - EV Station-based Rental System** project as a Frontend (FE) developer. This is a green mobility solution for smart cities, aiming to provide an "all-in-one" cloud-based platform that unifies searching, real-time booking, and payment, addressing the current service fragmentation.

Through my participation in project development, I have accumulated and significantly expanded my professional skill set, including:<br>
- **Frontend and Application Development:** I have become proficient in building cross-platform mobile applications using React Native and developing Web Dashboard management interfaces with Next.js. Additionally, I have practical experience in deploying and hosting web interfaces through AWS Amplify.<br>
- **Understanding of Cloud Architecture & Backend:** Although focused on Frontend, I have grasped the operational workflow of the Spring Boot Backend system and its integration with the comprehensive AWS ecosystem.<br>
I have approached and clearly understood the role of core services in the project, including:<br>
- **Compute & Containers:** Amazon ECS Fargate operates the backend and AWS Lambda for serverless processing.<br>
- **Storage & Databases:** Amazon S3 (Data Lake), Amazon RDS PostgreSQL (relational storage), and Amazon ElastiCache for Redis (caching).<br>
- **Connectivity & IoT:** AWS IoT Core (receiving sensor data), Amazon API Gateway (API management), and Amazon Cognito (secure user authentication).<br>
- **Data Processing & Distribution:** AWS Glue (ETL and Crawlers) and Amazon CloudFront (global content delivery network).<br>
- **Supporting Tools:** Using AWS CDK/SDK during infrastructure development and deployment.<br>

In my work, I always uphold a sense of responsibility, strive to complete all assigned targets, and comply with organizational regulations. Additionally, I proactively collaborate closely with colleagues to ensure smooth workflow and optimal efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship process, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

### Needs Improvement

Through my work experience at Amazon Web Services Vietnam, I recognize that I still have some limitations that need to be addressed:

* Regarding discipline:<br>
Current situation: Sometimes I am not strict enough with myself in absolutely adhering to administrative procedures or schedules.<br>
Plan: I will cultivate stricter time management habits and commit to strictly complying with company regulations as well as any organization I join in the future.

* Regarding problem-solving thinking:<br>
Current situation: When encountering complex technical issues in the project (e.g., real-time data processing or AWS integration), I sometimes feel confused and don't have an optimal solution immediately.<br>
Plan: I will develop the habit of analyzing root causes and thoroughly studying technical documentation (AWS Well-Architected Framework) to propose more systematic solutions.

* Regarding communication skills:<br>
Current situation: Expressing technical ideas or daily progress reports is sometimes not concise enough.<br>
Plan: I will learn to present issues more briefly and succinctly, and actively participate in group discussions to practice handling work situations.

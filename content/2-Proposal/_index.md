# The EV Station-based Rental System
## Electric Vehicle Rental and Return Software at Fixed Stations – A Green Mobility Solution for Smart Cities

### 1. Executive Summary
The EV Station-based Rental System is developed to provide an all-in-one platform for electric vehicle rental and charging management. It integrates real-time rental, payment, and charging station access through a unified cloud-native solution. The system features a React Native mobile app and a Spring Boot backend deployed on AWS ECS Fargate, with PostgreSQL (RDS) and Redis (ElastiCache) for data and caching. User authentication is managed via Amazon Cognito, and global delivery is optimized using CloudFront. Designed under the AWS Well-Architected Framework, the platform ensures scalability, high availability, and security while maintaining cost efficiency.

### 2. Problem Statement
### What’s the Problem?
Current electric vehicle (EV) rental services are fragmented, requiring users to switch between multiple apps to locate, book, and manage rentals at fixed points. This creates inconvenience, slow performance, and unreliable experiences — users often arrive at “unavailable” or “offline” rental points, leading to frustration and loss of trust.

For vehicle owners and operators, manual fleet management, booking coordination, and maintenance tracking result in operational inefficiencies and lost revenue. Currently, there is no unified, real-time platform connecting renters, vehicle owners, and rental point operators.

### The Solution
The EV Station-based Rental System consolidates EV rental and return at fixed points into a single, cloud-native platform. Built with React Native for mobile and Spring Boot for backend, the system delivers real-time booking, vehicle tracking, and payment integration.

Key AWS services include ECS Fargate for compute, RDS PostgreSQL for data storage, ElastiCache for low-latency performance, API Gateway and Cognito for secure access, and CloudFront for global content delivery. The platform supports both fleet-based and peer-to-peer (P2P) vehicle registration, providing a centralized interface for users and operators to manage rentals efficiently, securely, and at scale.

### Benefits and Return on Investment
The platform eliminates manual coordination and fragmented applications, offering a unified, automated experience for renters and fleet owners. Real-time data ensures reliability and transparency regarding vehicle availability and rental point status.

Designed under the AWS Well-Architected Framework, the system minimizes operational costs with a serverless, pay-per-use model while maintaining scalability and 99.99% uptime. Within 12–24 months, the platform is projected to reach 50,000+ monthly active users, onboard 200+ rental points, and deliver significant time, cost, and operational efficiencies for both users and operators.

### 3. Solution Architecture
The VoltGo platform adopts a serverless and fully private AWS architecture for secure and scalable backend operations. Backend run on Amazon ECS Fargate, connecting to Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 for relational data and ElastiCache Serverless (Redis) for caching.
All workloads are deployed in private subnets across multiple Availability Zones and accessed securely through API Gateway via AWS PrivateLink to an internal Network Load Balancer. User authentication is managed by Amazon Cognito, while the frontend is hosted on Amazon S3 and delivered globally via CloudFront, protected by AWS WAF and ACM SSL/TLS.
Monitoring and secrets management are handled by CloudWatch and Secrets Manager, with the entire infrastructure provisioned through Terraform IaC. This architecture ensures high security, elasticity, and cost efficiency suitable for the current development stage and future production scaling.

### 4. Technical Implementation
**Implementation Phases**
This project has two main parts—developing the backend locally and deploying it to the AWS cloud—each following four key phases:
   - 1.Build and Design Architecture:
 Develop and test backend services locally using Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, and Redis. Design the AWS serverless architecture including ECS Fargate, Aurora Serverless, ElastiCache, and API Gateway with PrivateLink connections. (Pre-deployment phase)
   - 2.Estimate Cost and Validate Feasibility:
 Use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate the monthly cost of ECS tasks, Aurora capacity units, and CloudFront bandwidth. Adjust design decisions to ensure cost-effectiveness and smooth migration.
   - 3.Configure and Deploy Infrastructure:
 Build and deploy cloud infrastructure using Terraform for IaC. Configure VPC, ECS, Aurora, ElastiCache, Cognito, and CloudFront. Validate IAM roles, networking, and private-only access via VPC Endpoints. 
   - 4.Test, Optimize, and Release:
 Deploy Dockerized services to ECS Fargate, test API Gateway → PrivateLink → NLB → ECS flow, and verify database connections. Enable CloudWatch monitoring, auto-scaling, and WAF protection. Optimize scaling thresholds and document final architecture. 


**Technical Requirements**

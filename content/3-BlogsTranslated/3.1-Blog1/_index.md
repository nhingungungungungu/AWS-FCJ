# Source Code Security Scanning with Amazon Q Developer

Software developers aim to build products that uphold the highest standards of privacy and data security, fostering trust and confidence among users and customers. Developers want to secure their software by identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in their source code, increasing resilience against cyber threats. **Amazon Q Developer**, a generative-AI–powered coding assistant, helps developers “shift left” and prioritize security early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) by providing guidance directly inside the IDE as they write code.

As a developer, you can use **Amazon Q Developer code security scanning** to proactively detect and eliminate vulnerabilities in both your existing source code and any new code you write in your IDE. Amazon Q Developer is equipped with thousands of **security detectors** across multiple programming languages, helping you build software that meets security requirements and delivers a trustworthy customer experience. Addressing findings produced by Amazon Q Developer reduces vulnerabilities early, lowering the cost of fixing issues later in the development process.

This post explores Amazon Q Developer’s source code security scanning feature and the security detectors it uses to evaluate your code. We first demonstrate the **auto-scan** capability, which evaluates code in real time as you write. Then, we walk through manually launching a security scan on your active project and its dependencies, reviewing vulnerability findings, and using **automated remediations** generated by Amazon Q Developer. Finally, we analyze the accuracy and performance of Amazon Q’s security scans and compare them with leading tools using trusted public benchmarks.

## Source Code Security Scanning

Amazon Q Developer supports secure coding practices by offering two ways to scan your code:

- **Scan your project** (on-demand full-project scanning)  
- **Scan as you code** (real-time IDE scanning)

Amazon Q Developer includes thousands of security detectors across more than a dozen programming languages—each offering particular strengths to provide broad vulnerability coverage. Each scan produces a **detection message**, describing the issue and offering a recommended fix. Some findings include **suggested code fixes** that Amazon Q Developer can apply directly within the IDE.

## Running Security Scans

To perform a scan, you must install the Amazon Q Developer plugin for your supported IDE. In this guide, we use **JetBrains IntelliJ**. After authenticating with Amazon Q Developer, you will see **Security Scans**, including **Run Project Scan**, inside the Amazon Q Developer menu.

If you are subscribed to **Amazon Q Developer Pro**, auto-scan is enabled by default, and you will see an additional option: **Pause Auto-Scans**.

When auto-scan is enabled, background scans run periodically and highlight detected issues in the file you are actively editing. For example, consider code that contains a **hard-coded password** used to connect to a database—this is a critical vulnerability because if committed, attackers could exploit it for unauthorized access.

While the developer is typing, Amazon Q highlights the problematic method call. Hovering over the highlighted line shows a pop-up with details about the finding, including:

- The associated **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)**  
- The **detector library** used  
- A **suggested code fix**, if available  

### Scan as You Code  
(Real-time scanning inside the IDE)

Even though auto-scan is exclusive to the Pro Tier, **manual project scans** are available in both the Pro Tier and Free Tier. You can evaluate the entire codebase by selecting **Run Project Scan**, which executes all detectors across your project.

### Full Project Scan

After Amazon Q completes scanning your project and dependencies, a new tab titled **Amazon Q Security Issues** appears, listing all identified vulnerabilities. Selecting an item opens the file where the issue was detected and highlights the problematic source code. Hovering over the highlight displays detailed vulnerability information, including the CWE (e.g., **CWE-798**) and remediation options.

### Locating Vulnerable Code  
### Understanding the Finding

Choosing **Amazon Q: Explain** within the information window provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability—how it works, why it’s dangerous, and how to fix it. In this example, Amazon Q recommends replacing the hard-coded password with an environment variable and explains why this approach increases security.

### Code Remediation

If Amazon Q Developer provides an automatic fix, it displays **“Yes”** under *Code fix available*. Clicking **Suggested code fix preview** shows the exact code modifications. Once satisfied, choose **Apply fix** to update your code automatically. In this example, the hard-coded password is replaced with secure environment variable access.

## Detection Accuracy & Benchmarking

We evaluate detection accuracy using **false positives** and **false negatives**:

- **False positive**: The tool reports a vulnerability that is not actually present  
- **False negative**: A real vulnerability exists but the tool fails to detect it  

Amazon Q’s detectors are designed with a **precision-optimized bias**—prioritizing low false positive rates without sacrificing recall. We benchmark Amazon Q Developer against other leading tools. Thanks to its precision-oriented design, Amazon Q matches or surpasses top tools in **precision** and exceeds them in **recall** in several benchmarks.

### Comparison on Public Benchmarks

| Benchmark       | Language | Metric     | Amazon Q | Best Other Tool |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| OWASP Top Rules | Java     | Precision | 84.7     | 75.7             |
|                 |          | Recall    | 100      | 92.1             |
| RailsGoat       | Ruby     | Precision | 100      | 100              |
|                 |          | Recall    | 13.3     | 26.6             |
| WebGoat         | Java     | Precision | 100      | 100              |
|                 |          | Recall    | 28.7     | 28.7             |
| CredData        | All      | Precision | 88.2     | 82.3             |
|                 |          | Recall    | 83.3     | 77.7             |

Beyond public benchmarks, Amazon Q Developer also performs strongly across extensive **internal benchmarks** that include:

- Public datasets  
- Additional curated examples  
- Verified internal false positives and false negatives  

Across all internal benchmarks, Amazon Q outperforms modern tools in **precision**, and leads in **recall** across 10 of 13 benchmarks.

## Conclusion

Amazon Q Developer’s source code security scanning feature enables developers to identify and fix vulnerabilities efficiently. By providing recommendations directly inside the IDE, Amazon Q helps integrate secure coding practices early in the SDLC. Developers can proactively scan legacy code and remediate vulnerabilities, while new code is continuously evaluated through auto-scanning with real-time suggestions.

Natural-language explanations help developers understand the vulnerabilities and write safer code. Amazon Q empowers developers to build secure, resilient software while reducing the cost and risk of addressing security issues later in the development cycle.

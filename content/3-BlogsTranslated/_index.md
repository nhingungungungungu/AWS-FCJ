###  [Blog 1 - AWS DevOps & Developer Productivity: Scanning Code Security with Amazon Q Developer](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog explores how software developers can maintain high standards of privacy and data security while building user trust. Amazon Q Developer, a generative AI–powered assistant, helps shift security left in the software development lifecycle by providing guidance directly in the IDE. Developers can proactively detect and remediate vulnerabilities in both existing and new code using Amazon Q Developer’s thousands of security detectors across multiple programming languages. The article demonstrates the auto-scan feature that evaluates code as it is written, shows how to run security scans on active projects and dependencies, review findings, and apply automated remediations. Finally, it analyzes the performance of Amazon Q Developer’s security scans compared with other tools on public benchmarks, highlighting how early vulnerability detection reduces downstream risks and development costs.

###  [Blog 2 - AWS Training and Certification: March 2025 Course and Certification Updates](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog provides the March 2025 update on new training courses and certification releases from AWS Training and Certification. These updates help you and your team build skills with AWS services and solutions efficiently. This month, AWS launched 13 new digital training products on AWS Skill Builder, including 9 new AWS Builder Labs, 3 new AWS Jam Journeys, and 1 new Digital Classroom course. AWS Skill Builder subscriptions are now available globally, providing access to advanced certification exam prep, hands-on labs, and interactive learning experiences like AWS Cloud Quest, AWS Industry Quest, AWS Builder Labs, and AWS Jam challenges. Some subscription plans also include AWS Digital Classroom courses, which combine expert-led instruction, demonstrations, hands-on labs, and knowledge checks to provide in-depth learning.

###  [Blog 3 - AWS Developer Tools: Deploying .NET Applications on ARM-based Compute Platforms](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog announces that AWS Deploy Tool for .NET now supports deploying .NET applications to ARM-based compute platforms such as AWS Graviton. Whether using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI, developers can target cost-efficient ARM infrastructures with a familiar experience. The article explains why deploying to ARM improves price/performance and energy efficiency, and how to get started in Visual Studio by installing the latest AWS Toolkit, selecting ARM-based publish targets, and configuring the project environment to Arm64. It also guides using the .NET CLI to install the deploy tool, select deployment options, and update the environment architecture. By leveraging ARM-based compute options, developers can enjoy better performance and cost efficiency without changing their existing workflows. The blog also provides next steps, including trying deployments on ARM-based compute and exploring the Developer Guide and GitHub repository for later documentation and sample projects.

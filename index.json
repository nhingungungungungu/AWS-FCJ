Developers want to secure their software by identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in their source code, increasing resilience against cyber threats. Amazon Q Developer, a generative-AI–powered coding assistant, helps developers “shift left” and prioritize security early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) by providing guidance directly inside the IDE as they write code.\nAs a developer, you can use Amazon Q Developer code security scanning to proactively detect and eliminate vulnerabilities in both your existing source code and any new code you write in your IDE. Amazon Q Developer is equipped with thousands of security detectors across multiple programming languages, helping you build software that meets security requirements and delivers a trustworthy customer experience. Addressing findings produced by Amazon Q Developer reduces vulnerabilities early, lowering the cost of fixing issues later in the development process.\nThis post explores Amazon Q Developer’s source code security scanning feature and the security detectors it uses to evaluate your code. We first demonstrate the auto-scan capability, which evaluates code in real time as you write. Then, we walk through manually launching a security scan on your active project and its dependencies, reviewing vulnerability findings, and using automated remediations generated by Amazon Q Developer. Finally, we analyze the accuracy and performance of Amazon Q’s security scans and compare them with leading tools using trusted public benchmarks.\nSource Code Security Scanning Amazon Q Developer supports secure coding practices by offering two ways to scan your code:\nScan your project (on-demand full-project scanning) Scan as you code (real-time IDE scanning) Amazon Q Developer includes thousands of security detectors across more than a dozen programming languages—each offering particular strengths to provide broad vulnerability coverage. Each scan produces a detection message, describing the issue and offering a recommended fix. Some findings include suggested code fixes that Amazon Q Developer can apply directly within the IDE.\nRunning Security Scans To perform a scan, you must install the Amazon Q Developer plugin for your supported IDE. In this guide, we use JetBrains IntelliJ. After authenticating with Amazon Q Developer, you will see Security Scans, including Run Project Scan, inside the Amazon Q Developer menu.\nIf you are subscribed to Amazon Q Developer Pro, auto-scan is enabled by default, and you will see an additional option: Pause Auto-Scans.\nWhen auto-scan is enabled, background scans run periodically and highlight detected issues in the file you are actively editing. For example, consider code that contains a hard-coded password used to connect to a database—this is a critical vulnerability because if committed, attackers could exploit it for unauthorized access.\nWhile the developer is typing, Amazon Q highlights the problematic method call. Hovering over the highlighted line shows a pop-up with details about the finding, including:\nThe associated Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) The detector library used A suggested code fix, if available Scan as You Code (Real-time scanning inside the IDE)\nEven though auto-scan is exclusive to the Pro Tier, manual project scans are available in both the Pro Tier and Free Tier. You can evaluate the entire codebase by selecting Run Project Scan, which executes all detectors across your project.\nFull Project Scan After Amazon Q completes scanning your project and dependencies, a new tab titled Amazon Q Security Issues appears, listing all identified vulnerabilities. Selecting an item opens the file where the issue was detected and highlights the problematic source code. Hovering over the highlight displays detailed vulnerability information, including the CWE (e.g., CWE-798) and remediation options.\nLocating Vulnerable Code Understanding the Finding Choosing Amazon Q: Explain within the information window provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability—how it works, why it’s dangerous, and how to fix it. In this example, Amazon Q recommends replacing the hard-coded password with an environment variable and explains why this approach increases security.\nCode Remediation If Amazon Q Developer provides an automatic fix, it displays “Yes” under Code fix available. Clicking Suggested code fix preview shows the exact code modifications. Once satisfied, choose Apply fix to update your code automatically. In this example, the hard-coded password is replaced with secure environment variable access.\nDetection Accuracy \u0026amp; Benchmarking We evaluate detection accuracy using false positives and false negatives:\nFalse positive: The tool reports a vulnerability that is not actually present False negative: A real vulnerability exists but the tool fails to detect it Amazon Q’s detectors are designed with a precision-optimized bias—prioritizing low false positive rates without sacrificing recall. We benchmark Amazon Q Developer against other leading tools. Thanks to its precision-oriented design, Amazon Q matches or surpasses top tools in precision and exceeds them in recall in several benchmarks.\nComparison on Public Benchmarks Benchmark Language Metric Amazon Q Best Other Tool OWASP Top Rules Java Precision 84.7 75.7 Recall 100 92.1 RailsGoat Ruby Precision 100 100 Recall 13.3 26.6 WebGoat Java Precision 100 100 Recall 28.7 28.7 CredData All Precision 88.2 82.3 Recall 83.3 77.7 Beyond public benchmarks, Amazon Q Developer also performs strongly across extensive internal benchmarks that include:\nPublic datasets Additional curated examples Verified internal false positives and false negatives Across all internal benchmarks, Amazon Q outperforms modern tools in precision, and leads in recall across 10 of 13 benchmarks.\nConclusion Amazon Q Developer’s source code security scanning feature enables developers to identify and fix vulnerabilities efficiently. By providing recommendations directly inside the IDE, Amazon Q helps integrate secure coding practices early in the SDLC. Developers can proactively scan legacy code and remediate vulnerabilities, while new code is continuously evaluated through auto-scanning with real-time suggestions.\nNatural-language explanations help developers understand the vulnerabilities and write safer code. Amazon Q empowers developers to build secure, resilient software while reducing the cost and risk of addressing security issues later in the development cycle.\nLearn more about Amazon Q Developer: Getting started with Amazon Q Amazon Q Developer User Guide Scanning your code with Amazon Q "},{"uri":"https://github.com/nhingungungungungu/AWS-FCJ/4-eventparticipated/4.1-event1/","title":"Event 1 - Kick-off AWS FCJ Workforce - FPTU OJT FALL 2025","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Summary Report: “Kick-off AWS FCJ Workforce – FPTU OJT Fall 2025 provided an overview of the program, AWS tools, and OJT expectations for students.”\nEvent Objectives\nIntroduce the AWS FCJ Workforce program and the OJT Fall 2025 plan Guide students on OJT workflow, timeline, and key activities Set expectations for skills development and learning outcomes Provide information on AWS tools and platforms to be used Speakers / Organizers\nKha Van – Program Coordinator, FPT University Key Highlights\nEvent held on Saturday, September 6, 2025, 8:30 - 12:00 GMT+7 at Bitexco Financial Tower, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City Overview of the program: OJT structure, AWS modules, timeline, and key milestones Introduction to platforms, tools, and guidance for AWS environment setup for students Direct interaction between students and mentors about learning expectations and effective study methods Event Experience\nStudents gained a clear view of the OJT journey with AWS and the skills to develop Opportunities to exchange ideas with mentors and support teams, enhancing teamwork and soft skills Understanding how to prepare, plan, and effectively participate in AWS Hands-on labs, workshops, and final assessments Lessons Learned / Takeaways\nClear understanding of objectives and structure of AWS FCJ Workforce Fall 2025 OJT Preparedness regarding tools, learning environment, and AWS resources Set expectations for skills, progress, and outcomes after completing the OJT "},{"uri":"https://github.com/nhingungungungungu/AWS-FCJ/4-eventparticipated/4.2-event2/","title":"Event 2, 3, 4 - AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1#2#3","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Event 2 - AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 provided participants with an overview of AI/ML/GenAI on AWS, hands-on demos, and practical guidance for building generative AI solutions.”\nEvent Objectives\nIntroduce AI/ML and Generative AI landscape on AWS Demonstrate AWS AI/ML services and SageMaker Studio Provide guidance on prompt engineering and RAG integration Enable hands-on experience building a generative AI chatbot Speakers\nKha Van – AWS Vietnam Workshop facilitators from AWS AI/ML team Key Highlights\nDate \u0026amp;

Node.js API on AWS Lightsail serving product/catalog/cart operations. Lightsail MySQL/Postgres for transactional data. Amazon Cognito for signup/login and API authorization. Amazon S3 for product image storage via presigned uploads. CloudWatch for API logging and Secrets Manager for DB password + bucket config. Traffic assumption: \u0026lt;100k requests/month with no advanced autoscaling required. Focus is reliability, secure media handling, and fast global delivery.\nObjectives (Workshop Outcomes) Architecture clarity: Explain how S3+CloudFront, Lightsail API/DB, Cognito, and Secrets Manager fit together for a small-but-secure e-commerce stack. Hands-on delivery: Stand up CDN-hosted frontend, API tied to Secrets Manager, Cognito auth, secure image uploads to S3, and end-to-end logging in CloudWatch. Success criteria (from proposal): Page load \u0026lt;2s globally (CloudFront + S3). Stable Lightsail API under expected load. Secure DB operations with fast queries. Cognito signup/login stable. Image uploads secure to S3. API logging visible in CloudWatch. Scope Core catalog CRUD, shopping cart basics. Cognito-based authentication and token verification on API. Presigned S3 uploads for product images. CDN + HTTPS via CloudFront/ACM; Route 53 domain mapping. CloudWatch logging/metrics; Secrets Manager for DB password + bucket name. Timeline guidance: 6–12 weeks across assessment → infra → backend → frontend → testing → handover. Out of Scope (per proposal) AI/ML features, advanced e-commerce flows, complex image processing. Multi-region/DR, complex admin portals, third-party integrations. Advanced autoscaling or sophisticated CI/CD beyond basic deploys.

CloudFront + S3 (static hosting): React build served globally with ACM TLS; Route 53 maps domain. CloudFront has origin access to S3. Cognito: User Pool issues JWTs for signup/login; React uses tokens to call the API. Why it matters: Fast global delivery (\u0026lt;2s target), standard SSL, and auth tokens for protected API calls.\n5.2.2 API \u0026amp; Data Lightsail API (Node.js): CRUD for products, cart, and image upload orchestration. Runs with IAM role permission to read Secrets Manager. Lightsail DB (MySQL/Postgres): Stores catalog, users, cart/orders. Private to the API instance. Secrets Manager: Holds DB password and bucket name (DB_PASSWORD, APP_CONFIG). API fetches at startup/first use. CloudWatch Logs: Captures API access/error logs; base for operational and light analytics queries. S3 (media bucket): Private bucket for product images. Upload flow uses presigned URLs from the API; CloudFront reads images. Security highlights: HTTPS everywhere, CloudFront-to-S3 access controlled, DB credentials never hardcoded, IAM least privilege on the API role.\n5.2.3 Identity \u0026amp; Access Amazon Cognito: Signup/login, token issuance; API validates JWT for protected routes. Route 53 + ACM: Domain + TLS cert for CloudFront; optional custom domain for API if exposed. IAM: API instance role limited to Secrets Manager + CloudWatch; S3 bucket policy grants CloudFront read access; uploads only via presigned PUT. 5.2.4 Operations \u0026amp; Observability CloudWatch: API logs/metrics, alarms for error rates/latency. Backup/DR (lightweight): DB snapshots via Lightsail schedule; S3 versioning optional. Cost posture: Lightsail for predictable monthly cost; S3/CF/Cognito/SM/CW minimal at stated traffic. 5.2.5 Delivery Phases (6–12 weeks from proposal) Assessment (Week 1): Requirements, architecture diagram, DB schema, secrets list. Base infra (Week 2): S3 hosting, CloudFront+ACM, Route 53, Lightsail API/DB, Cognito setup, Secrets Manager entries, CloudWatch logging. Backend (Week 3): Secrets fetch, presigned upload, CRUD, Cognito token verification, CloudWatch logs. Frontend (Week 4): React shop UI, Cognito login UI, upload UI, API integration, deploy to S3+CF. Testing \u0026amp; go-live (Week 5): FE↔API↔S3↔DB integration, security tests (IAM/SM), E2E testing. Handover (Week 6): Secrets update runbook, ownership transfer, operations guide.

Events are POSTed to the Lightsail API, which validates and logs them as JSON to CloudWatch Logs. Product images upload through presigned URLs generated by the API; CloudFront reads images from the private S3 bucket. This meets observability needs while staying within the project’s cost/scope constraints.\n5.3.2 Event/Log schema (suggested) Identity: userId (if logged in), clientId, sessionId, userLoginState, identitySource. Event: eventName, eventTimestamp. Product context: productId, name, category, brand, price, discountPrice, urlPath. Request/meta: path, method, statusCode, latencyMs, userAgent, sourceIp, requestId. Store as structured JSON in CloudWatch for later export/query.\n5.3.3 API responsibilities /events: accept validated event payloads; reject unknown types. Presigned uploads: issue PUT URLs with content-type and key constraints. Secrets: fetch DB_PASSWORD and APP_CONFIG (bucket name) from Secrets Manager; no hardcoded secrets. Logging: write structured CloudWatch entries for auth success/fail, CRUD, uploads, and business events. 5.3.4 Frontend wiring Use Cognito JWT for authenticated calls; treat guests with generated clientId + sessionId. Persist clientId (localStorage) and sessionId (sessionStorage) with idle timeout. Non-blocking fire-and-forget POST per event; retries are optional but should not block UI. Image upload flow: request presigned URL → PUT file to S3 → send metadata/key back to API. 5.3.5 Validation checklist Trigger events (browse, view product, add to cart, start/complete checkout). Confirm API returns 2xx; verify S3 uploads succeed via presigned URL. In CloudWatch Logs, verify structured events with identity/product fields. Confirm Secrets Manager reads (no hardcoded DB creds/bucket). Verify CORS + HTTPS end to end; ensure CloudFront can read the image bucket, uploads are private.

Storage: Keep logs in CloudWatch with sensible retention (e.g., 30–90 days). Export path: Enable CloudWatch → S3 export for ad-hoc analysis when needed. Query: Use CloudWatch Log Insights for quick views; use Athena on exported S3 logs for deeper analysis. This avoids a separate DWH while still giving behavior and reliability visibility.\n5.4.2 Optional light ETL (if needed) Set an export task (daily) from CloudWatch Logs to an S3 bucket (logs/\u0026lt;yyyy\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;mm\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;dd\u0026gt;/). In Athena, create an external table over the exported JSON; partition by date. Derive a single events view with key fields: eventName, userId, sessionId, productId, statusCode, latencyMs, timestamp. Keep costs low by: Compressing exports (GZIP). Dropping high-cardinality noise fields. Restricting retention in S3 (lifecycle to Glacier/expire after X days). 5.4.3 Security and access No public analytics endpoints: exports stay in a private S3 bucket. IAM least privilege: API instance role: Secrets Manager read, CloudWatch logs write, S3 put for exports (if used). CloudFront only reads from the image bucket; uploads remain private via presigned PUT. Secrets: DB password + bucket name stored in Secrets Manager; rotate via runbook. Encryption: HTTPS everywhere; S3 bucket encryption enabled; export bucket private. 5.4.4 Operational checks Alarms on API 5xx rate, p95 latency, auth failures. Periodic validation: CloudWatch export jobs succeed (if enabled). Cognito JWT verification still passes after config changes. Presigned upload permissions stay scoped (content-type, key prefix). 5.4.5 Future extension (beyond current scope) Introduce a small RDS read-replica or a dedicated analytics DB if queries grow. Add Lambda transform to normalize events into an events table (daily batch). Add BI tooling (QuickSight) on top of Athena or the analytics DB for richer dashboards.

QuickSight (optional): lightweight dashboards over Athena; keep SPICE size small. 5.5.2 Suggested CloudWatch queries Reliability: error rate, p95 latency by route; top failing endpoints; auth failures. Behavior: count by eventName; product popularity (productId, category); checkout completion rate. Uploads: success vs failure for presigned PUT (filter by statusCode and path). Save queries and pin to a CloudWatch dashboard for quick ops visibility.\n5.5.3 If using Athena/QuickSight Export CloudWatch logs to S3 daily. Create an external table over the JSON; partition by date. Example metrics: Events over time, event mix by userLoginState. Product views vs add-to-cart vs checkout_complete. Error rate and p95 latency by route. In QuickSight, build 3 visuals: KPI tiles (total events, error rate, p95 latency). Funnel (product_view → add_to_cart → checkout_start → checkout_complete). Top products (views and carts). 5.5.4 Access and security Keep the export bucket private; limit Athena/QuickSight access to project admins.
